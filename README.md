## Supported LLMs

- ‚úÖ OpenAI
- ‚úÖ Cohere Command R and Command R+
- ‚úÖ LlamaCPP (open-source)

## Usage / Examples

### Use with Local or Cloud LLMs

Example: LLM with access to a weather API

```python
from aidoot.llms import LlamaCppChatCompletion
from aidoot.tools import get_current_weather, wikipedia_search
from aidoot.tool_executor import need_tool_use

llm = LlamaCppChatCompletion.from_default_llm(n_ctx=0)
llm.bind_tools([get_current_weather, wikipedia_search])  # Add tools from LangChain

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "how is the weather in London today?"}
]

output = llm.chat_completion(messages)

if need_tool_use(output):
    print("Using weather tool")
    tool_results = llm.run_tools(output)
    tool_results[0]["role"] = "assistant"

    updated_messages = messages + tool_results
    updated_messages.append({"role": "user", "content": "Think step by step and answer my question based on the above context."})
    output = llm.chat_completion(updated_messages)

print(output.choices[0].message.content)
```

Certainly, let's break down the information provided in the weather data for London:

1. **Temperature**: It is currently 23¬∞C (73¬∞F) in London.
2. **Cloud Cover**: There are no clouds at the moment.
3. **Humidity**: The humidity level is 38%.
4. **Precipitation**: There has been no precipitation today, with 0 inches recorded.
5. **Pressure**: The atmospheric pressure is 1023 hPa (30 inches).
6. **Visibility**: The visibility is currently 10 km (6 miles).
7. **Weather Condition**: It's a sunny day in London.
8. **Wind**: The wind is blowing from the northwest at a speed of 9 km/h (6 mph).

Based on this information, it seems like today is a beautiful and sunny day in London. The temperature is quite pleasant, and there's no precipitation to worry about. It's a great time to be outdoors!

`AIDoot` also supports the Cohere API for tool use and function calling. Check out the reproducible notebook [here](https://github.com/aniketmaurya/agents/blob/main/examples/cohere.ipynb).

### Multi-modal Agent üëÅü§ñÔ∏è

Build AI agents that can see the world with computer vision.

Example: Using a multi-modal agent with image recognition

```python
from agents.llms import LlamaCppChatCompletion
from agents.tools import wikipedia_search, google_search, image_inspector

llm = LlamaCppChatCompletion.from_default_llm(n_ctx=0)
llm.bind_tools([google_search, wikipedia_search, image_inspector])

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that has access to tools and uses them to help humans."},
    {"role": "user", "content": f"Check this image {image_url} and suggest me a location in London that looks similar."}
]

output = llm.chat_completion(messages)
tool_results = llm.run_tools(output)

updated_messages = messages + tool_results
messages = updated_messages + [{"role": "user", "content": "Please answer based on the tool results."}]
output = llm.chat_completion(messages)

print(output.choices[0].message.content)
```

Based on the image you provided, it appears to be a nature boardwalk surrounded by lush green grass and a peaceful
sky filled with clouds. The presence of people indicates that it could be a popular spot for outdoor activities or
leisurely walks. If you're looking for a similar location in London, you might consider visiting one of the city's
many parks or nature reserves. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Richmond Park**: The largest royal park in London, with open grasslands, wooded areas, and lakes. It's ideal for walking, cycling, and enjoying the outdoors.
2. **Hampstead Heath**: Known for its ponds, meadows, and woodlands. It's popular for picnics, sunbathing, and hiking.
3. **Greenwich Park**: Offers panoramic views of the city, along with several historic buildings, including the Royal Observatory.
4. **Victoria Park**: A smaller park known for its lakes and gardens.
5. **Hyde Park**: A central park with attractions like the Serpentine Lake and Speaker's Corner.

These locations offer a peaceful, natural environment similar to the image, making them perfect for a relaxing day outdoors in London.
