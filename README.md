```

## Usage/Examples

### Simple tool use with a local or cloud LLM

LLM with access to weather API:

```python
from agents.llms.llm import LlamaCppChatCompletion
from agents.tools import get_current_weather, wikipedia_search

llm = LlamaCppChatCompletion.from_default_llm(n_ctx=0)
llm.bind_tools([get_current_weather, wikipedia_search])  # Add any tool from LangChain

messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that has access to tools and use that to help humans."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is the weather in London?"}
]
output = llm.chat_completion(messages)
tool_results = llm.run_tool(output)
print(tool_results)
```

You can also use Cohere's API for tool use/function calling:

```python
from agents.tools import get_current_weather

from agents.llms._cohere import CohereChatCompletion
from agents.tool_executor import need_tool_use

llm = CohereChatCompletion()
llm.bind_tools([get_current_weather])

messages = [
    {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant that has access to tools. Use the tools only if you don't have answers."
    },
    {"role": "user", "content": "how is the weather in London today?"}
]

output = llm.chat_completion(messages)

if need_tool_use(output):
    tool_results = llm.run_tool(output)
    tool_results[0]["role"] = "assistant"

    updated_messages = messages + tool_results
    updated_messages = updated_messages + [{"role": "system", "content": "Do not use any tools now."},
                                           {"role": "user",
                                            "content": "Think step by step and answer my question based on the above context."}
                                           ]
    output = llm.chat_completion(updated_messages)

print(output.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Multi-modal Agent üëÅü§ñÔ∏è

You can build an AI Agent that can see the world with computer vision.

```python
from agents.llms.llm import LlamaCppChatCompletion
from agents.tools import get_current_weather, wikipedia_search, google_search, image_inspector

llm = LlamaCppChatCompletion.from_default_llm(n_ctx=0)
llm.bind_tools([google_search, wikipedia_search, image_inspector])

image_url = "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg/2560px-Gfp-wisconsin-madison-the-nature-boardwalk.jpg"
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that has access to tools and use that to help humans."},
    {"role": "user",
     "content": f"Check this image {image_url} and suggest me a location where I can go in London which looks similar"}
]
output = llm.chat_completion(messages)
tool_results = llm.run_tool(output)

updated_messages = messages + tool_results
messages = updated_messages + [{"role": "user", "content": "please answer me, based on the tool results."}]
output = llm.chat_completion(messages)
print(output.choices[0].message.content)
```
